          <h2>What is browser compatibility?</h2><br>
          Browser compatibility is the ability of a browser to correctly interpret the hypertext markup language (HTML) that web pages provide. It ensures everybody can view a website in the same way, regardless of the browser a visitor is using. Itâ€™s primarily related to functionality and vital for user experience.<br>
          <br>
          Good practice as a developer is to develop for maximum browser compatibility and make sure that the intended functionality is in all browsers and prioritized over design. Otherwise visitors might not be able to access all features on a website. They might be able to navigate the website, but the experience may not be as intended.<br>
